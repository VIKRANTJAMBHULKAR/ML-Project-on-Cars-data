# ML-Project-on-Cars-data

This machine learning project utilizes a dataset containing information about cars, encompassing features such as car name, year of manufacture, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, owner count, and selling price. Leveraging Python libraries like scikit-learn and Pandas, the project aims to develop predictive models for various tasks such as predicting car selling prices based on features like year, mileage, and transmission type, or classifying cars based on their fuel type and seller type. Through machine learning techniques such as regression or classification, the project seeks to provide insights into factors influencing car prices and market dynamics, aiding both buyers and sellers in decision-making processes within the automotive industry.
